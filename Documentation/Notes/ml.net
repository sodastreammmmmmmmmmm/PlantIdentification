Visual Studio has a feature called ‘Machine Learning Model (ML.NET)’. This feature allows users to run different types of machine learning algorithms on a suitable dataset. This feature includes machine learning algorithms such as data classification, value prediction, image classification recommendation and object detection.
When using this feature, you are first asked to select the scenario, which is the type of machine learning algorithm you want to use. For this we will select image classification, as that is the type of problem that this honours project is exploring.
Next, we are prompted to select an environment. We are given the option of locally using the CPU or the GPU or using the Azure cloud. The options for GPU and the Azure cloud are mark preview on my computer, as they require some set up, so to avoid having to do extensive setup I will continue with using the CPU on my current machine.
Then you are prompted to give a folder full of training data. For the first run I will make use of the ‘Flowers Recognition’ dataset by Alexander Mamaev (https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition) as it is relatively small and should not take too long to run. Bellow is the data preview given by Visual Studio.
 
The next set is to start training. This takes a while, as although the dataset is relatively small there are still 4317 images to train the dataset on and depending on the algorithm this can take multiple iterations. The first few attempts to train resulted in failure. Visual Studio would say it was training for a few hours then would pop up with error messages.
After numerous attempts I managed to get ML.NET to train. I was given an accuracy of 89.22% and training took 5198 seconds. 
The downside to this feature is that we are not given to the code to determine what type of algorithm is used to perform this image classification. However, the Microsoft website for the ML.NET feature states that they make use of a multinomial logistic regression algorithm (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/image-classification). 
 I hadn’t heard of multinomial logistic regression algorithms before this, so I had to do some research.
