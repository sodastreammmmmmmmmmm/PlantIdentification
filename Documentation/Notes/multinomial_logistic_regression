Multinomial logistic regression is the type of algorithm that ML.NET makes use of. 

Multinomial logistic regression, also refered to as the multinomial logistic models is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to 
"predict categorical placement in or the probability of category membership on a dependent variable based on multiple independent variables. 
The independent variables can be either dichotomous (i.e., binary) or continuous (i.e., interval or ratio " scale)." (https://it.unt.edu/sites/default/files/mlr_jds_aug2011.pdf)
In short, this means that this is a classification algorithm that works for problems where we have more than two possible classifications for.
