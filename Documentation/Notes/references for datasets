Flowers Recognition - Alexander Mamaev (https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)
  4242 images of different types of flowers. Only has 5 flower types (daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower and tulip) so not very advanced.
  Flowers look vastly different so it is easy to get a high classification accuracy
  
LeafSnap (http://leafsnap.com/dataset/)
  23146 lab images and 7719 field images. Covers 185 species of tree, many of which have similar features.
  The trees are American so would not be able to gather my own testing images locally.
  
Plant dataset - Alex Olariu (https://www.kaggle.com/alexo98/plant-dataset)
  54.3K images of 38 species. Contains a test and a train dataset. 
  Very little information given, so if I'm going to use this one it will have to be in a virtual environment
