Targets
  Research multinomial logistic regression algorithms
  Find out how ML.NET evaluates algorithms
  Research different methods of testing
  Update literature review with new information
  Fix bugs with CNN 
  Update the ghantt chart with new plan
  Start planning how to implement a multinomial logistic regression algorithm
  
  Targets Reached
  Researched multinomial logistic regression algorithms
  Attempted to bug fix the CNN, and now there is more
  Almost finished the ghantt chart, just need to add a few more tasks
  Looked into how to implement a MLR algorithm
  Struggling to find out how ML.NET evaluates the algorithms
